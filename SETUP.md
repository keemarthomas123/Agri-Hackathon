# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide

## Step 1: Setup MySQL Database

### Create the database in MySQL:
1. Open MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or MySQL command line
2. Run this command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE agri_store;
```

3. Then run the SQL from `Server/database.sql` to create the tables

**OR** run this in command line:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < Server/database.sql
```

## Step 2: Configure Database Credentials

Edit `Server/.env` file and add your MySQL password:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_NAME=agri_store
```

## Step 3: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd Server
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
Connected to MySQL database successfully!
Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

## Step 4: Start the Frontend (React)

In a NEW terminal:
```bash
npm start
```

Your app will open at `http://localhost:3000`
